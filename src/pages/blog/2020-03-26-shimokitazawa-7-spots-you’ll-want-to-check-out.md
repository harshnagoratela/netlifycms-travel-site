#### 2. New York Joe Exchange

Another major attraction of this town is vintage shopping. New York Joe now has several chain shops in Tokyo but it all started in Shimokitazawa. Believe it or not, the building used to be a bathhouse! “Bathhouse” translates toNyu-yoku-join Japanese, hence they named the shop “New York Joe”.
